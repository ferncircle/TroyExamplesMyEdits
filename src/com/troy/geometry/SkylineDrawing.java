 * Given skyline of a city merge the buildings
 *
 * Time complexity is O(nlogn)
 * Space complexity is O(n)

 * 
 * Solution:
 * For each building, decide if to include start and end wall in final result. create two walls from a 	building 
 * {x1,h, isStart=true} and {x2,h,isStart=false}, sort by x. 
 *	** If it's start wall, add it to queue and check if it changes the maxHeight in queue, if does then include
 *	** If it's end wall, remove height from queue, check if max height changes, 
 *			if does then include current max height from queue
